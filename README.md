📊 **Created by Noor AlOmari**

## 📌 Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard explores key healthcare performance metrics across hospitals, focusing on:

- 🛌 **Average Length of Stay (LOS)**
- 💸 **Cost per Discharge**
- 🧠 **Key Influencers of Patient Outcomes**
- 📍 **Top & Least Performing Hospitals**
- 📊 **KPIs on Discharges, Surgeons, and Facilities**

The goal is to uncover patterns in patient discharge behavior, identify cost outliers, and highlight how severity and risk levels influence LOS.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- 🔺 Longer LOS is linked to extreme severity of illness and higher mortality risk.
- 💡 New York City hospitals show significantly higher LOS averages.
- 📈 Hospitals like Kings County and Interfaith have the highest cost per discharge.
- 🏥 151 hospitals and over 26K discharges analyzed for decision-making insights.
